## 📖 Overview
**Product Management App** is a responsive single-page web application built with **React**, **Axios**, and **Bootstrap**.  
It allows users to **add, edit, delete, and search** product data dynamically.  
The app integrates a public API via Axios for unique ID generation and uses React’s **state management (`useState`)** to handle real-time updates — all without reloading the page.
